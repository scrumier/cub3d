**Cub3D** is a 3D graphics project inspired by classic FPS games. It leverages raycasting to create a 3D view from a 2D map, allowing players to explore and interact within a virtual environment.

## Controls
- **WASD**: Move forward, backward, and strafe left/right.
- **Left/Right Arrows**: Rotate the player‚Äôs view.
- **F**: Open and close doors.
